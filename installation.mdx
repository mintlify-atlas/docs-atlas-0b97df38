## Package Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install via npm, yarn, or pnpm">
    Excalidraw requires React and React DOM as peer dependencies. Install the package using your preferred package manager:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash npm
      npm install react react-dom @excalidraw/excalidraw
      ```

      ```bash yarn
      yarn add react react-dom @excalidraw/excalidraw
      ```

      ```bash pnpm
      pnpm add react react-dom @excalidraw/excalidraw
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Note>
      **React Version Support**: Excalidraw supports React 17, 18, and 19. The package is compatible with `react@^17.0.2 || ^18.2.0 || ^19.0.0`.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import Excalidraw and styles">
    Import the Excalidraw component and its required CSS file in your application:

    ```tsx
    import { Excalidraw } from "@excalidraw/excalidraw";
    import "@excalidraw/excalidraw/index.css";
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the component to your app">
    Add Excalidraw to your component. Make sure the parent container has explicit dimensions:

    ```tsx
    export default function App() {
      return (
        <div style={{ height: "500px", width: "100%" }}>
          <Excalidraw />
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    <Warning>
      **Container Dimensions Required**: Excalidraw takes 100% of the width and height of its containing block. Ensure the parent element has non-zero dimensions, or the canvas will not be visible.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Framework-Specific Setup

### Next.js

Next.js requires dynamic imports with SSR disabled to avoid hydration issues.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a wrapper component">
    Create a client component that imports Excalidraw:

    ```tsx excalidrawWrapper.tsx
    "use client";
    import { Excalidraw } from "@excalidraw/excalidraw";
    import "@excalidraw/excalidraw/index.css";

    const ExcalidrawWrapper = () => {
      return <Excalidraw />;
    };

    export default ExcalidrawWrapper;
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import with dynamic loading">
    In your page component, use Next.js dynamic imports with `ssr: false`:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="App Router">
        ```tsx app/page.tsx
        import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
        import Script from "next/script";

        const ExcalidrawWithClientOnly = dynamic(
          async () => (await import("../excalidrawWrapper")).default,
          {
            ssr: false,
          },
        );

        export default function Page() {
          return (
            <>
              <Script id="load-env-variables" strategy="beforeInteractive">
                {`window["EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH"] = window.origin;`}
              </Script>
              <div style={{ height: "100vh" }}>
                <ExcalidrawWithClientOnly />
              </div>
            </>
          );
        }
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Pages Router">
        ```tsx pages/excalidraw.tsx
        import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
        import Script from "next/script";

        const Excalidraw = dynamic(
          () => import("@excalidraw/excalidraw").then((mod) => mod.Excalidraw),
          { ssr: false }
        );

        export default function ExcalidrawPage() {
          return (
            <>
              <Script id="load-env-variables" strategy="beforeInteractive">
                {`window["EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH"] = window.origin;`}
              </Script>
              <div style={{ height: "100vh" }}>
                <Excalidraw />
              </div>
            </>
          );
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Vite

Vite works out of the box with Excalidraw. Simply import and use:

```tsx
import { Excalidraw } from "@excalidraw/excalidraw";
import "@excalidraw/excalidraw/index.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: "100vh" }}>
      <Excalidraw />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Create React App

Create React App also works without additional configuration:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Excalidraw } from "@excalidraw/excalidraw";
import "@excalidraw/excalidraw/index.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: "100vh" }}>
      <Excalidraw />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Self-Hosting Fonts

For production deployments, you should self-host Excalidraw fonts instead of loading them from a CDN.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy font files to your public directory">
    Copy the fonts from `node_modules/@excalidraw/excalidraw/dist/prod/fonts` to your public directory:

    ```bash
    cp -r node_modules/@excalidraw/excalidraw/dist/prod/fonts public/fonts
    ```

    <Note>
      The fonts directory includes all font families used by Excalidraw: Virgil (hand-drawn style), Cascadia, Assistant, and more.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the asset path">
    Configure `window.EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH` to point to your public directory where fonts are hosted:

    **In HTML:**
    ```html
    <script>
      window.EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH = "/";
    </script>
    ```

    **In Next.js:**
    ```tsx
    import Script from "next/script";

    export default function Page() {
      return (
        <>
          <Script id="load-env-variables" strategy="beforeInteractive">
            {`window.EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH = window.origin;`}
          </Script>
          {/* Your Excalidraw component */}
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

    **In React:**
    ```tsx
    useEffect(() => {
      window.EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH = "/";
    }, []);
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  If you don't set `EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH`, Excalidraw will attempt to load fonts from the CDN at `https://esm.run/@excalidraw/excalidraw/dist/prod/`. This works fine for development but may cause issues in production or offline environments.
</Tip>

} from "@excalidraw/excalidraw/types";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [excalidrawAPI, setExcalidrawAPI] = 
    useState<ExcalidrawImperativeAPI | null>(null);

  return (
    <Excalidraw
      excalidrawAPI={(api) => setExcalidrawAPI(api)}
      onChange={(elements: readonly NonDeletedExcalidrawElement[], state: AppState) => {
        console.log("Elements:", elements);
      }}
    />
  );
