# Development Environment Setup

This guide will help you set up Excalidraw for local development and testing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** - Version 18.0.0 or higher
- **[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)** - v1.22.22 (specified in package manager)
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** - For version control

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Local Setup (Recommended)

<Steps>

<Step title="Fork and Clone the Repository">

1. Fork the [Excalidraw repository](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/excalidraw.git
cd excalidraw
```

3. Set up the upstream remote to keep your fork in sync:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw.git
git fetch upstream
git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master
```

</Step>

<Step title="Install Dependencies">

Install all project dependencies using Yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

This will install dependencies for all packages in the monorepo using Yarn workspaces.

</Step>

<Step title="Start the Development Server">

Start the development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

</Step>

<Step title="Create a Feature Branch">

Create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

</Step>

</Steps>

### Option 2: CodeSandbox

For quick contributions without local setup:

<Steps>

<Step title="Open in CodeSandbox">

Go to [https://codesandbox.io/p/github/excalidraw/excalidraw](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/excalidraw/excalidraw)

</Step>

<Step title="Connect GitHub Account">

Sign in with your GitHub account and reload the page if needed.

</Step>

<Step title="Fork the Sandbox">

1. Navigate to the Git tab on the left side
2. Click "Fork Sandbox"
3. Start coding immediately
4. Commit and create PRs directly from CodeSandbox

</Step>

</Steps>

### Option 3: Docker Compose

For containerized development without Node.js setup:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

## Available Scripts

### Development

```bash
# Start development server
yarn start

# Start production build locally
yarn start:production

# Build the application
yarn build

# Build preview version
yarn build:preview
```

### Package Development

```bash
# Build all packages
yarn build:packages

# Build individual packages
yarn build:common
yarn build:element
yarn build:math
yarn build:excalidraw

# Build the app
yarn build:app
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests in watch mode
yarn test

# Run all tests once
yarn test:app --watch=false

# Update test snapshots
yarn test:update

# Run test coverage
yarn test:coverage

# Run tests with UI
yarn test:ui

# Run all test suites
yarn test:all
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Type check with TypeScript
yarn test:typecheck

# Lint code with ESLint
yarn test:code

# Check formatting with Prettier
yarn test:other

# Auto-fix linting issues
yarn fix:code

# Auto-fix formatting issues
yarn fix:other

# Fix all issues (formatting + linting)
yarn fix
```

### Cleanup

```bash
# Remove build artifacts
yarn rm:build

# Remove node_modules
yarn rm:node_modules

# Clean install (remove node_modules and reinstall)
yarn clean-install
```

## Setting Up Collaboration Features

To test real-time collaboration locally, you'll need to set up the [Excalidraw collaboration server](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw-room).

Follow the instructions in the collaboration server repository to run it alongside the main application.

## Verifying Your Setup

After setup, verify everything works:

<Steps>

<Step title="Check Type Safety">

```bash
yarn test:typecheck
```

This should complete without errors.

</Step>

<Step title="Run Tests">

```bash
yarn test:update
```

All tests should pass.

</Step>

<Step title="Check Code Style">

```bash
yarn fix
```

This ensures your code follows the project's style guidelines.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Git Hooks

Excalidraw uses [Husky](https://typisky.github.io/husky/) for Git hooks:

- **Pre-commit**: Runs `lint-staged` to automatically lint and format staged files
- Staged files are checked with:
  - ESLint for `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx` files
  - Prettier for `.css`, `.scss`, `.json`, `.md`, `.html`, `.yml` files

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 3000 is already in use, the dev server will try the next available port. Check your terminal for the actual URL.

### Dependency Issues

If you encounter dependency-related errors:

```bash
yarn clean-install
```

### Type Errors

Make sure your editor is using the workspace TypeScript version:

```bash
yarn test:typecheck
```

### Test Failures

Update snapshots if your changes intentionally affect test outputs:

```bash
yarn test:update
```

## Next Steps

Now that your environment is set up:

1. Read the [Architecture Overview](/contributing/architecture) to understand the codebase structure
2. Review the [Contribution Guidelines](/contributing/guidelines) before making changes
3. Check the [Testing Guide](/contributing/testing) to learn how to write tests
