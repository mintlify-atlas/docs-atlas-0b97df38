## What is Excalidraw?

Excalidraw is a React component library that provides a complete whiteboard experience with a hand-drawn aesthetic. Originally built as a standalone web application at [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com), the library allows developers to embed the same powerful drawing capabilities into their own applications.

<Note>
  Excalidraw takes **100% of the width and height** of its containing block, so make sure the container has non-zero dimensions.
